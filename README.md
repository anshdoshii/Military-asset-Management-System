A System that will enable commanders and logistics personnel to manage the movement, assignment and expenditure of critical assets (such as vehicles, weapons, and ammunition) across multiple bases. The system must provide transparency, streamline logistics and ensure accountability, while offering a secure and role-based solution.

The system must facilitate:


Tracking of Opening Balances, Closing Balances, and Net Movements (Purchases + Transfers In - Transfers Out).
Recording of asset assignments and expended.
Transfers of assets between bases with a clear history of movements.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate data access.
